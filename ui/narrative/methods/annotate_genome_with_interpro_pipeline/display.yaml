description : |
    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for the InterProScan pipeline.</p>
    <p>This method maps protein sequences in an annotated genome to InterPro using the InterProScan annotation pipeline.</p>
    <P>InterPro provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and important sites by using predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different databases that make up the InterPro consortium. InterPro combines signatures from multiple, diverse databases into a single searchable resource, reducing redundancy. Current members of the InterPro consortium are: PROSITE, Pfam, PRINTS, ProDom, SMART, TIGRFAMs, PIRSF, SUPERFAMILY, GENE3D, PANTHER, CDD and HAMAP.</p>
    <p>InterProScan is a software package that searches for a protein sequence against the InterPro database and provides an overview of the predicted families that a protein belongs to and any domains or sites it contains. This App wraps InterProScan into KBase, allowing you to annotate the coding DNA sequences in a genome with InterPro entries and Gene Ontology terms. You can reference the designated InterPro entry for a protein sequence to see which signatures from the InterPro consortium databases are used to classify its families or to predict domains.</p>
